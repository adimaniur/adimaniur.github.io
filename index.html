        <h3>Did you find peace?</h3>
        <p>One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a
          horrible
          vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly,
          slightly
          domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to
          slide off
          any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as
          he
          looked.</p>

        <p>"What's happened to me? " he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too
          small,
          lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table -
          Samsa
          was a travelling salesman - and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated
          magazine
          and housed in a nice, gilded frame.</p>

        <p>It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered
          the
          whole of her lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather.
          Drops of
          rain could be heard hitting the pane, which made him feel quite sad. "How about if I sleep a little bit longer
          and
          forget all this nonsense", he thought, but that was something he was unable to do because he was used to
          sleeping on
          his right, and in his present state couldn't get into that position.</p>

        <p>However hard he threw himself onto his right, he always rolled back to where he was. He must have tried it a
          hundred
          times, shut his eyes so that he wouldn't have to look at the floundering legs, and only stopped when he began
          to feel
          a mild, dull pain there that he had never felt before. "Oh, God", he thought, "what a strenuous career it is
          that I've
          chosen! Travelling day in and day out.</p>

        <h3>Getting up early</h3>

        <p>Doing business like this takes much more effort than doing your own business at home, and on top of that
          there's the
          curse of travelling, worries about making train connections, bad and irregular food, contact with different
          people all
          the time so that you can never get to know anyone or become friendly with them. It can all go to Hell! " He
          felt a
          slight itch up on his belly; pushed himself slowly up on his back towards the headboard so that he could lift
          his head
          better; found where the itch was, and saw that it was covered with lots of little white spots which he didn't
          know
          what to make of; and when he tried to feel the place with one of his legs he drew it quickly back because as
          soon as
          he touched it he was overcome by a cold shudder. He slid back into his former position. "Getting up early all
          the
          time", he thought, "it makes you stupid. You've got</p>
